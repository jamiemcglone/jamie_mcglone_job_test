Hello, welcome to my Function. developer challenge submission.

To run the site, you first need to open up your terminal and cd into the root folder of the submission, it should be called jamie_mcglone_function_test. When you are here, you need to run npm install.

After that, you can run npm run dev and go to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser, the site should be running there.

If there are any issues accessing this solution please let me know, I am available at jamie.mcglone@outlook.com

Thank you for your time ðŸ˜Š
